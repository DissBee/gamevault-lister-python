to run this script, do the following:

python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

NOTE!!!
If you are using anything other than bash this won't work
run the appropriate "activate" for your shell - for fish it is:
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate.fish

Then, once you are in the venv, run this:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you should be good to run the script:
python gamevault-lister-python.py
